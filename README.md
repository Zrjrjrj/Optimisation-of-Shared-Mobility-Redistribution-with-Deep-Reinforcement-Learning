# Optimisation-of-Shared-Mobility-Redistribution-with-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
This project is to explore the application of Reinforcement Learning to vehicle rebalancing decisions. An openai gym environment will be developed to test the effectiveness of a range of Reinforcement Learning techniques to optimising redistributing efforts across a range of conditions.
